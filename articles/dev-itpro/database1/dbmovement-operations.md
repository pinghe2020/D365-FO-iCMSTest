* Batch job history in the BatchJobHistory, BatchHistory, and BatchConstraintHistory tables.
* SMTP password in the SysEmailSMTPPassword table.
* SMTP Relay server in the SysEmailParameters table.
* Print Management settings in the PrintMgmtSettings and PrintMgmtDocInstance tables.
* Environment-specific records in the SysServerConfig, SysServerSessions, SysCorpNetPrinters, SysClientSessions, BatchServerConfig, and BatchServerGroup tables.
* Document attachments in the DocuValue table.
* All users except for the administrator are disabled.
* All batch jobs are set to Withhold status.
